# MasterMindFPGA

In this project, I designed a simple board game called Mastermind. I used both combinational and sequential circuit designs to implement this project. This game aims to find the given three 3-bit numbers by using the switches. In the code, I provided the values of these three 3-bit numbers, and the mission of the second player is to guess these values in 9 attempts. When the second player decides to submit their answer, they push the answer button, and in the seven-segment display, the results are updated. In the seven-segment display, I showed how many attempts are left and I put a letter ‘A’ to denote the “attempt”. Also, I showed how many numbers are guessed correctly and how many of them are in the correct place, and I put the letters ‘n’ and ‘p’ respectively to distinguish which number represents which attribute. The game is over when there is no attempt left or the number of correct places and the number of correct numbers are equal to 3. In the first case, the player lost the game, and on the seven-segment “60” will be displayed to represent “Game Over”. In the second case, the player wins the game, and on the seven-segment “66” will be displayed to represent “Good Game”. When the game is over, the player can use the reset button and start to play again.
